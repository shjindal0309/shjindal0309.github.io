  I am Shubham Jindal, currently working as Senior Software Engineer at TikTok in Global Payments Team. I have over 
  5+ years of experience in the tech industry. At TikTok, I work on building highly available and resilient payment systems
  where we process more than $50 million transactions everyday on TikTok Shop.
  
  Before TikTok, I spent 2 years at Flipkart (a Walmart subsidiary), where I led a team of software engineer in 
  <b> Search Spyder </b> data team where I led a team of software and data engineers, before transitioning to TikTok, 
  where I currently lead a team of software engineers.
  
  My expertise lies in designing and developing scalable data pipelines and visualization solutions using technologies such as Apache Spark, Kafka, and other distributed computing environments. I have a strong foundation in software engineering, following the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), including high-level and low-level design, as well as implementation in Golang, C++, Python, and Java, based on project requirements. Additionally, I have extensive experience working with various database technologies, including SQL, NoSQL (Redis, Hive, MongoDB), and graph databases.
  I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and a Master's degree in Computer Science from Stony Brook University.

  Hi, my name's Brett and I'm a senior network system administrator. As well as administrating systems I also have experience making software and web apps. I have worked at a number of companies gaining teamwork and leadership skills.
