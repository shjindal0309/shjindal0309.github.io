      ## <i class="fas fa-book"></i> **Ensuring Configuration Consistency Across Multi-Regional Data Centers**
      **Publishing Date:** February 2025  
      **Publisher:** International Research Journal of Modernization in Engineering Technology and Science (IRJMETS)  
      **Abstract:**
      <i>Today nearly every big company operates several data centers spread across the world. Each of these data 
      centers hosts a variety of infrastructure services like MySQL, Redis, Hive, Message Queue etc. Now for any
      company it's very important to write the same code for all regions for scalability and following the DRY (Donâ€™t
      repeat yourself) aspect of system design. But the people who are designing and writing these codes are spread
      across multiple regions and due to that sometimes they are not aligned on every system configs. Sometimes
      even within the same region software engineers are not aligned properly on these system configs as to what
      system configs to keep for that region. Because of that, data center system configs start differing across multiple
      regions. Now it is very important to make sure these configurations are the same across all regions because it
      can lead to a major critical issues in your team. In this paper, we will first introduce what the problem is, then
      we will talk about existing solutions and then we will talk about proposed solutions and how it tackles all the
      problems listed in the introduction section.</i>

      **Publishing Date:** March 2025  
      **Publisher:** International Journal of Computer Trends and Technology (IJCTT)  
      **Abstract:**
      <i>With the increasing costs of public cloud services such as AWS, Azure, and GCP, many companies opt to establish
        their private cloud infrastructure. This transition necessitates the development of an adequate Infrastructure 
      as a Service (IaaS) team to manage and maintain the data center. A key challenge in this domain is monitoring the 
      health of the bare metals (also called servers) to ensure high availability and reliability. This paper presents
      a comprehensive approach to bare metal health monitoring in private data centers. We will discuss the problem
      statement literature review, outline an industry-standard solution, propose a high-level system design to ensure
      real-time monitoring, fault detection, and automated remediation, and provide experimental results to show how
      our approach is better than existing industry solutions.</i>

      **Publishing Date:** July 2025  
      **Publisher:** Dzone (https://dzone.com/)  
      **Abstract:**
      <i>Language models are designed to predict what words are likely to come next in a sequence, assigning 
      probabilities to each possible continuation. In this article, we explore how an N-gram language model works, 
      how it assigns probabilities to sentences and sequences of words, and then examine how well this model performs. 
      By understanding and evaluating this approach, we gain insight into how language models handle the complexity of
      human language.</i>
